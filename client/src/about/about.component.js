        lovac strives to surround <b>information</b> around the use and
        effectiveness of vaccines, particularly a COVID-19 vaccine.
        More importantly, it highlights the importance of <b>local vaccination</b> ("lo-vac"),
        and what cities and communities need to do in order for a vaccine to be successful.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There are a lot of misconceptions that float around vaccines, due to the abundance of
        misinformation attached to them. With the COVID-19 vaccine, it's going to be even worse. We don't
        even have a vaccine out yet and there are theories that the government will take away our freedom
        through them.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With lovac, the goal is to make people understand that immunization is a process and it does not
        happen overnight. lovac guides people to raise awareness for vaccination and use their
        voice and knowledge to promote vaccination in their cities.
